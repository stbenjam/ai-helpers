# AI Helpers

A collection of Claude Code plugins to automate and assist with various development tasks.

[Discover available plugins](https://openshift-eng.github.io/ai-helpers/)

## Installation

### From the Claude Code Plugin Marketplace

1. **Add the marketplace:**
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add openshift-eng/ai-helpers
   ```

2. **Install a plugin:**
   ```bash
   /plugin install jira@ai-helpers
   ```

3. **Use the commands:**
   ```bash
   /jira:solve OCPBUGS-12345 origin
   ```

## Updating Plugins

To get the latest plugin versions:

1. **Update the marketplace** (fetches latest plugin catalog):
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace update ai-helpers
   ```

2. **Reinstall the plugin** (downloads new version):
   ```bash
   /plugin install <plugin>@ai-helpers
   ```

### Automatic Catalog Sync

Add a SessionStart hook to automatically sync the marketplace catalog on each session. In your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "command": "claude plugin marketplace update ai-helpers",
        "timeout": 30000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note:** This only refreshes the catalog (what's available). To actually update an installed plugin to a newer version, you still need to reinstall it with `/plugin install <plugin>@ai-helpers`.

### Other Tools

Coding agents like OpenCode, Gemini, Cursor and more can consume Claude Code
plugins using the [Agent Package Manager (APM)](https://github.com/microsoft/apm).

Example `apm.yml`:

```yaml
name: my-project
version: 1.0.0
description: My project is great. 
target: [claude, cursor, gemini, opencode]

dependencies:
  - openshift-eng/ai-helpers/plugins/bigquery
```

Then run `apm install`.  It can install to your project only, or with a `--global` scope.

## Using the Container

A container is available with Claude Code and the marketplace already
available. This is primarily for use in OpenShift CI.

### Building the Container

```bash
podman build -f images/Dockerfile -t ai-helpers .
```

### Running with Vertex AI and gcloud Authentication

To use Claude Code with Google Cloud's Vertex AI, you need to pass through your gcloud credentials and set the required environment variables:

```bash
podman run -it \
  -e CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1 \
  -e CLOUD_ML_REGION=your-ml-region \
  -e ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id \
  -v ~/.config/gcloud:/home/claude/.config/gcloud:ro \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  ai-helpers
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1` - Enable Vertex AI integration
- `CLOUD_ML_REGION` - Your GCP region (e.g., `us-east5`)
- `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` - Your GCP project ID

**Volume Mounts:**
- `-v ~/.config/gcloud:/home/claude/.config/gcloud:ro` - Passes through your gcloud authentication (read-only)
- `-v $(pwd):/workspace` - Mounts your current directory into the container

### Running Commands Non-Interactively

You can execute Claude Code commands directly without entering an interactive session using the `-p` or `--print` flag:

```bash
podman run -it \
  -e CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1 \
  -e CLOUD_ML_REGION=your-ml-region \
  -e ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id \
  -v ~/.config/gcloud:/home/claude/.config/gcloud:ro \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  ai-helpers \
  --print "/hello-world:echo Hello from Claude Code!"
```

This will:
1. Start the container with your gcloud credentials
2. Execute the `/hello-world:echo` command with the provided message
3. Print the response and exit when complete

## Available Plugins

For a complete list of all available plugins and commands, see the **[AI Helpers Marketplace](https://openshift-eng.github.io/ai-helpers/)**.

## Plugin Development

Want to contribute or create your own plugins? Check out the `plugins/` directory for examples.
Make sure your commands and agents follow the conventions for the Sections structure presented in the hello-world reference implementation plugin (see [`hello-world:echo`](plugins/hello-world/commands/echo.md) for an example).

### Ethical Guidelines

Plugins, commands, skills, and hooks must NEVER reference real people by name, even as stylistic examples (e.g., "in the style of <specific human>").

**Ethical rationale:**
1. **Consent**: Individuals have not consented to have their identity or persona used in AI-generated content
2. **Misrepresentation**: AI cannot accurately replicate a person's unique voice, style, or intent
3. **Intellectual Property**: A person's distinctive style may be protected
4. **Dignity**: Using someone's identity without permission diminishes their autonomy

**Instead, describe specific qualities explicitly**

Good examples:

* "Write commit messages that are direct, technically precise, and focused on the rationale behind changes"
* "Explain using clear analogies, a sense of wonder, and accessible language for non-experts"
* "Code review comments that are encouraging, constructive, and focus on collaborative improvement"

When you identify a desirable characteristic (clarity, brevity, formality, humor, etc.), describe it explicitly rather than using a person as proxy.

### Adding New Commands

**Check for overlaps first** - Before coding, validate your idea:

```bash
/utils:review-ai-helpers-overlap --idea "brief description of your command"
```

Collaborating on existing work instead of duplicating parallel efforts is always encouraged when overlap is found. This helps maintain a clean, non-redundant plugin collection in such an actively developed project (see [`/utils:review-ai-helpers-overlap`](plugins/utils/commands/review-ai-helpers-overlap.md) for detailed usage).

When contributing new commands:

1. **If your command fits an existing plugin**: Add it to the appropriate plugin's `commands/` directory
2. **If your command doesn't have a clear parent plugin**: Add it to the **utils plugin** (`plugins/utils/commands/`)
   - The utils plugin serves as a catch-all for commands that don't fit existing categories
   - Once we accumulate several related commands in utils, they can be segregated into a new targeted plugin

### Creating a New Plugin

If you're contributing several related commands that warrant their own plugin:

1. Create a new directory under `plugins/` with your plugin name
2. Create the plugin structure:
   ```
   plugins/your-plugin/
   ├── .claude-plugin/
   │   └── plugin.json
   └── commands/
       └── your-command.md
   ```
3. Register your plugin in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

### Validating Plugins

This repository uses [skillsaw](https://github.com/stbenjam/skillsaw) to validate plugin structure:

```bash
make lint
```
