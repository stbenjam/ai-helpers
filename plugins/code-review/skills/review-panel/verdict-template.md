### Panel Synthesis

<Synthesize all findings — internal specialists and external reviewers (if any). Resolve any disagreements between reviewers. Where an external reviewer corroborates an internal specialist, note the convergence. Where they conflict, explain the resolution. If Devil's Advocate flags a concrete failure scenario, it is blocking unless another specialist provides a specific technical refutation. Ratify the disposition. State the strategic call. If reviewers agreed and the change is straightforward, say so plainly in one or two sentences.>
