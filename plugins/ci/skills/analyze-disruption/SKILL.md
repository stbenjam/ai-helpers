# Analyze Disruption

This skill analyzes disruption events recorded in Prow CI job runs. It downloads interval/timeline data,
audit logs, and pod logs, then correlates disruption across backends and job runs to identify root causes.

## Prerequisites

1. **gcloud CLI Installation**
   - Check if installed: `which gcloud`
   - The `test-platform-results` bucket is publicly accessible — no authentication required

2. **Python 3** (3.7 or later)

## Input Format

The user will provide:

1. **One or more Prow job URLs** (required, at least 1)
   - Example: `https://prow.ci.openshift.org/view/gs/test-platform-results/logs/periodic-ci-openshift-release-master-ci-4.21-e2e-aws-ovn/1983307151598161920`

2. **`--backends` flag** (optional) — comma-separated list of backend names to focus on
   - Example: `--backends kube-api,oauth-api,openshift-api`
   - If omitted, analyze all backends that show disruption

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Parse and Validate Input

1. **Extract job URLs and flags**
   - Parse all positional arguments as Prow job URLs
   - Parse `--backends` flag if present, split on comma to get backend filter list
   - Validate at least one URL is provided

2. **Parse each URL** to extract bucket path, job name, and build ID
   - Use the same URL parsing logic as the "prow-job-artifact-search" skill
   - Accept both `prow.ci.openshift.org` and `gcsweb-ci` URL formats
   - Extract `build_id` and `job_name` from each URL

3. **Construct deep links** for each job run — these go **inline throughout the report**
   wherever the run or a specific artifact is referenced, not in a separate table:

   **Run-level links** (use when first mentioning a run):
   - **Prow job page**: `https://prow.ci.openshift.org/view/gs/test-platform-results/logs/{job_name}/{build_id}`
   - **Sippy intervals**: `https://sippy.dptools.openshift.org/sippy-ng/job_runs/{build_id}/{job_name}/intervals`

   **GCS artifact deep links** (use when citing specific evidence):
   - Base: `https://gcsweb-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/gcs/test-platform-results/logs/{job_name}/{build_id}/artifacts/`
   - Timeline file: `{gcs_base}{target}/openshift-e2e-test/artifacts/junit/e2e-timelines_spyglass_{timestamp}.json`
   - Audit logs dir: `{gcs_base}{target}/gather-extra/artifacts/audit_logs/`
   - etcd pod logs: `{gcs_base}{target}/gather-extra/artifacts/pods/openshift-etcd/`
   - Journal logs: `{gcs_base}{target}/gather-extra/artifacts/journal_logs/`
   - Must-gather: `{gcs_base}{target}/gather-extra/artifacts/must-gather/`

   Where `{target}` is the ci-operator target extracted from prowjob.json (e.g., `e2e-azure-ovn-upgrade`).

   **Inline linking style**: When discussing evidence, link directly to the artifact.
   For example: "Run 1 ([Prow][prow1] | [Intervals][int1]) showed 11 disruptions in
   the [timeline data][timeline1]..." — where `[timeline1]` links to the specific
   `e2e-timelines_spyglass_*.json` file on gcsweb.

### Step 2: Create Working Directories

Compute `{date}` as today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., `2026-03-23`).

For each job run:

```bash
mkdir -p .work/disruption-analysis/{date}/{build_id}/logs
mkdir -p .work/disruption-analysis/{date}/{build_id}/tmp
```

Check for existing artifacts first. If `.work/disruption-analysis/{date}/{build_id}/logs/` exists with content,
ask user whether to reuse or re-download.

### Step 3: Download prowjob.json for Each Run

Use the `fetch-prowjob-json` skill for each job run URL.

1. Save to `.work/disruption-analysis/{date}/{build_id}/logs/prowjob.json`
2. Extract `JOB_NAME` from `.spec.job`
3. Extract the `--target=` value from ci-operator args

### Step 4: Download and Analyze Interval/Timeline Data

For each job run:

#### 4.1: Find and Download Interval Files

**Important GCS bucket note**: Prow URLs may contain `origin-ci-test` in the path (e.g.,
`/view/gs/origin-ci-test/logs/...`), but the actual GCS bucket is always `test-platform-results`.
Always use `gs://test-platform-results/...` for `gcloud storage` commands.

**Recommended approach — use `gcloud storage ls` then download individually**:

The artifact search script and wildcard `gcloud storage cp` are unreliable for finding timeline
files, especially in upgrade jobs where files are nested under multiple workflow step directories.
Instead, list files first, then download each one:

```bash
# Step 1: List all timeline files in the job's artifact tree
gcloud storage ls "gs://test-platform-results/logs/{job_name}/{build_id}/artifacts/**/e2e-timelines_spyglass_*.json"
```

This returns the full GCS paths for each timeline file. Then download each one individually:

```bash
# Step 2: Download each file
gcloud storage cp "gs://test-platform-results/logs/{job_name}/{build_id}/artifacts/{target}/openshift-e2e-test/artifacts/junit/e2e-timelines_spyglass_{timestamp}.json" \
  .work/disruption-analysis/{date}/{build_id}/logs/ --no-user-output-enabled
```

**Timeline file locations vary by job type**:

- **Non-upgrade jobs**: Usually one timeline file at
  `artifacts/{target}/openshift-e2e-test/artifacts/junit/e2e-timelines_spyglass_{timestamp}.json`

- **Upgrade jobs**: Usually two timeline files (one per phase — upgrade and conformance), which
  may be under different workflow step directories. The `gcloud storage ls` approach handles this
  automatically.

**Fallback — artifact search script**:

If `gcloud storage ls` doesn't find files, try the artifact search script:

```bash
python3 plugins/ci/skills/prow-job-artifact-search/prow_job_artifact_search.py \
  <prow-url> search "**/e2e-timelines_spyglass_*.json"
```

Note: The GCS URIs returned by this script may not always be directly downloadable with
`gcloud storage cp`. If downloads fail, extract the path components and construct the
`gs://test-platform-results/...` URI manually, or use `gcloud storage ls` to verify the
actual file locations.

#### 4.2: Run the Disruption Parser

Use the included `parse_disruption.py` script to extract and classify disruption events:

```bash
python3 plugins/ci/skills/analyze-disruption/parse_disruption.py \
  .work/disruption-analysis/{date}/{build_id}/logs/e2e-timelines_spyglass_*.json \
  --backends {backend_filter} \
  --window 60 \
  --format text
```

Use `--format json` when you need structured data for further analysis. Omit `--backends` to
analyze all disrupted backends.

The script automatically:
- Extracts all disruption events (Error/Warning level)
- Classifies each backend (cache, non-cache, canary, cloud)
- Detects which **phase** each disruption occurred in (upgrade vs conformance) — the first
  timeline file (sorted by filename) is the upgrade phase, the second is the conformance/e2e
  test phase. The phase is reported in the summary (`phase_breakdown`) and on each disruption event.
- Detects source-node fan-out patterns (critical for host-to-host analysis)
- Extracts concurrent events within the disruption window (±`--window` seconds)
- Summarizes OVS vswitchd stalls, CPU pressure, Azure disk metrics, etcd pressure
- Assesses network-liveness status (clean, minor, degraded, unreliable)

Review the parser output and use it as the foundation for the analysis. The parser handles
Steps 4.2 through 4.6 below.

#### 4.3: Interval File JSON Structure Reference

Each item in the timeline JSON has this structure:

```json
{
  "level": "Error",
  "source": "Disruption",
  "locator": {
    "type": "Disruption",
    "keys": {
      "backend-disruption-name": "host-to-host-new-connections",
      "connection": "new",
      "disruption": "host-to-host-from-node-...-worker-X-to-node-...-master-0-endpoint-10.0.0.5"
    }
  },
  "message": {
    "reason": "DisruptionBegan",
    "humanMessage": "... stopped responding to GET requests over new connections",
    "annotations": { "reason": "DisruptionBegan" }
  },
  "from": "2026-03-21T21:50:24Z",
  "to": "2026-03-21T21:50:26Z"
}
```

Key fields:
- **`source`**: Event category. `"Disruption"` for disruption events. Other useful sources:
  `OVSVswitchdLog`, `CPUMonitor`, `CloudMetrics`, `EtcdLog`, `EtcdDiskCommitDuration`,
  `EtcdDiskWalFsyncDuration`, `AuditLog`, `Alert`, `NodeMonitor`, `MachineMonitor`,
  `ClusterVersion`, `ClusterOperator`, `E2ETest`, `KubeletLog`
- **`level`**: `"Error"`, `"Warning"`, `"Info"`. Disruption events are Error or Warning.
- **`locator.keys.backend-disruption-name`**: The backend being monitored
- **`locator.keys.disruption`**: For host-to-host backends, encodes source node, target node,
  and endpoint IP in the format `host-to-host-from-node-{src}-to-node-{dst}-endpoint-{ip}`
- **`locator.keys.connection`**: `"new"` or `"reused"`
- **`message.reason`**: `"DisruptionBegan"` or `"DisruptionEnded"`
- **`message.humanMessage`**: Human-readable description with error details

#### 4.4: Classify Disruption by Backend Type

The parser classifies backends automatically. For reference:

1. **Cache backends** — name contains `cache` → likely **etcd or global networking** problem
2. **Non-cache backends** — standard backends → likely **component or cluster networking** problem
3. **ci-cluster-network-liveness** — canary polling external endpoint → **test infra network** issues
4. **Cloud network-liveness backends** — cloud provider canaries → **cloud provider** issues

**Key diagnostic pattern**: When all 4 variants of a backend fail simultaneously (e.g.,
`openshift-api-new-connections`, `openshift-api-reused-connections`, `cache-openshift-api-new-connections`,
`cache-openshift-api-reused-connections`), the root cause is almost always **control plane node
resource exhaustion** (disk I/O → etcd stalls → apiserver timeouts), not a networking issue.
Look for etcd `slow fdatasync`, `apply took too long`, and `ExtremelyHighIndividualControlPlaneCPU`
alerts as confirming evidence.

#### 4.5: Source-Node Analysis

The parser detects source-node patterns automatically. Key patterns:

- **single-source-fan-out**: All disruptions from one node to many targets. Indicates a
  source-side issue (OVS stall, CPU starvation, disk I/O) — not a network-wide problem.
- **multi-source**: Disruptions from multiple source nodes. Suggests a network-wide,
  destination-side, or infrastructure-level issue.
- **unknown**: Backend type doesn't include node info in the disruption path (e.g.,
  ingress-routed backends like image-registry).

When a single-source-fan-out pattern is detected, focus the investigation on that specific
node: check its CPU, disk I/O, OVS vswitchd logs, and whether it was running heavy workloads.

#### 4.6: Identify Concurrent Cluster Activity

The parser extracts concurrent events from these sources within the disruption window:

| Source | What it tells you |
|--------|-------------------|
| `OVSVswitchdLog` | OVS packet processing stalls (poll intervals >500ms = networking frozen) |
| `CPUMonitor` | Nodes with CPU >95% (starves OVS and other system processes) |
| `CloudMetrics` | Azure disk IOPS saturation, queue depth, bandwidth (disk I/O pressure) |
| `EtcdLog` | apply took too long, slow fdatasync, ReadIndex delays |
| `EtcdDiskCommitDuration` | etcd disk commit above 25ms threshold |
| `EtcdDiskWalFsyncDuration` | etcd WAL fsync above 10ms threshold |
| `AuditLog` | API request failures during disruption |
| `Alert` | Firing Prometheus alerts (ExtremelyHighIndividualControlPlaneCPU, etc.) |
| `NodeMonitor` / `MachineMonitor` | Node NotReady, machine phase changes |
| `ClusterVersion` / `ClusterOperator` | Upgrade progress, operator status |
| `E2ETest` | Active test phase (upgrade vs post-upgrade e2e tests) |

If the parser output is insufficient for a particular signal, you can query the timeline
JSON directly for deeper investigation.

### Step 5: Review Key Signals from Parser Output

The parser output from Step 4.2 already includes audit log events, etcd events, CPU warnings,
OVS stalls, and cloud metrics extracted from the timeline files. For most analyses, this is
sufficient — the timeline files aggregate the same data that would be found in separate
artifact downloads.

Review the parser's `concurrent_events` and `key_signals` sections and assess:

#### 5.1: Audit Log Signals

The timeline files contain `AuditLog` entries showing request failures during disruption windows
(e.g., "1 requests made during this time failed out of 611 total").

For kube-api, oauth-api, and openshift-api disruption, check whether:
- **Audit entries show failures during disruption** → API server received requests but couldn't process them (internal issue)
- **No audit entries during disruption** → requests never reached the API server (connectivity issue)

#### 5.2: etcd Signals

The timeline files contain `EtcdLog`, `EtcdDiskCommitDuration`, and `EtcdDiskWalFsyncDuration` entries.
Key messages to look for:
- `"apply request took too long"` — etcd under write pressure
- `"slow fdatasync"` — disk I/O bottleneck
- `"waiting for ReadIndex response took too long"` — etcd read latency
- Commit duration above 25ms or WAL fsync above 10ms thresholds

#### 5.3: CPU and Resource Pressure

The timeline files contain `CPUMonitor` (>95% threshold) and `CloudMetrics` (Azure disk IOPS,
queue depth, bandwidth, latency) entries.

Key patterns:
- **CPU >95% on the disruption source node** → OVS/networking starvation
- **Azure disk IOPS at 100%** → disk I/O saturation cascading to CPU and etcd
- **Disk queue depth >10x threshold** → severe I/O contention

#### 5.4: OVS vswitchd Stalls

`OVSVswitchdLog` entries report "Unreasonably long poll interval" warnings when OVS cannot
process packets. Poll intervals >1000ms mean OVS was essentially frozen — no packets forwarded.
This is the most direct cause of host-to-host and pod-to-host disruption.

#### 5.5: E2E Test Correlation

Query the timeline files for `E2ETest` source items that overlap the disruption window. The test
name is in `locator.keys.e2e-test`. For each test active during disruption, note:
- Test name, start time, end time
- Whether it passed (`level: "Info"`) or failed (`level: "Error"`)

**For multi-run analysis**: Cross-reference tests active during disruption across runs. Tests
appearing in 3+ runs during the disruption window are especially interesting — they may be
triggering the resource pressure that causes disruption (e.g., tests that create many resources,
run heavy workloads, or cause pod evictions). Include a table of correlated tests in the report
with pass/fail status per run.

Note: Tests that *fail* during the disruption window are usually *victims* of the disruption,
not causes. Tests that *pass* but consistently appear during disruption across runs are more
likely to be contributing to the resource pressure that triggers it.

### Step 6: Deep-Dive Artifact Download (Optional)

**Only perform this step if the parser output from Step 4.2 is insufficient for root cause
determination** — for example, when you need to see the full audit log request details or
etcd log context beyond what the timeline summaries provide.

#### 6.1: Download Audit Logs (if needed)

```bash
gcloud storage cp -r "gs://test-platform-results/{bucket-path}/artifacts/{target}/gather-extra/artifacts/audit_logs/" \
  .work/disruption-analysis/{date}/{build_id}/logs/audit_logs/ --no-user-output-enabled 2>/dev/null || true
```

Query for sampler requests during disruption windows to identify request gaps.

#### 6.2: Download etcd Pod Logs (if needed)

```bash
gcloud storage cp -r "gs://test-platform-results/{bucket-path}/artifacts/{target}/gather-extra/artifacts/pods/openshift-etcd/" \
  .work/disruption-analysis/{date}/{build_id}/logs/etcd-pods/ --no-user-output-enabled 2>/dev/null || true
```

Search for leader changes, write delays, member issues, and disk problems.

#### 6.3: PromQL Queries for Manual Investigation

If the analysis needs live cluster metrics (not available in artifacts), provide these queries:

```promql
-- Top CPU consumers across all nodes
topk(25, sum by (namespace) (rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container!="",pod!=""}[5m])))

-- CPU on a specific node
topk(25, sum by (namespace) (rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container!="",pod!="",node="<node-name>"}[5m])))

-- E2E test CPU on a specific node
topk(10, sum by (namespace) (rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container!="",pod!="",node="<node-name>",namespace=~"^e2e-.*"}[5m])))
```

### Step 7: Additional Diagnostic Checks

#### 7.1: Node Shutdown Sequencing

If disruption coincides with node events, check:

- Did the poller go `readyz=false` as expected when the node was shutting down?
- Were endpoint slices updated accordingly?
- Did the test framework watcher see the endpoint was removed and stop disruption polling?

Look for these signals in interval files and node-related logs.

#### 7.2: Endpoint Slice Updates

Check audit logs for endpoint slice modification events during disruption windows:

- Look for audit events related to `endpointslices` resources
- Verify that readiness changes triggered appropriate endpoint updates

### Step 8: Cross-Run Comparison (Multiple Runs Only)

When multiple job run URLs are provided:

#### 8.1: Align Disruption Events

For each backend that shows disruption across multiple runs:

- Compare which backends are disrupted in each run
- Identify backends that are **consistently disrupted** across all runs (systemic issue)
- Identify backends that are **disrupted in only some runs** (intermittent or infrastructure-specific)

#### 8.2: Pattern Detection

Look for common patterns:

- **Same backends disrupted at similar relative times** → likely a product bug or test sequencing issue
- **Same backends but different times** → likely infrastructure-sensitive but product-related
- **Different backends across runs** → likely infrastructure/environment-specific
- **ci-cluster-network-liveness disrupted in some runs** → those runs have unreliable disruption
  data. Still include them in the analysis, but note the caveat prominently (in the Runs Analyzed
  table and wherever citing evidence from that run). Do not exclude unreliable runs entirely —
  they can still confirm patterns seen in reliable runs, and their non-disruption signals (etcd
  logs, CPU, alerts) remain valid. The key is to avoid drawing conclusions *solely* from an
  unreliable run's disruption counts.
- **Cache backends consistently disrupted** → systemic etcd or networking issue
- **Non-cache backends consistently disrupted** → component-specific problem

#### 8.3: Correlate etcd and CPU Findings

- Are etcd leader changes present in all runs showing cache-backend disruption?
- Do runs with mass disruption consistently show high CPU or node pressure?
- Are audit log gaps consistent across runs?

### Step 9: Generate Report

Produce a structured Markdown report with **inline deep links** throughout. Links go where the
evidence is discussed, not in a separate section at the end. Use Markdown reference-style links
to keep the text readable.

### Inline Linking Rules

1. **First mention of a run** — include `([Prow]({prow_url}) | [Intervals]({sippy_url}))` after
   the build ID or run number
2. **Citing evidence from a specific artifact** — deep-link to the exact file on gcsweb, e.g.:
   - `[timeline data]({gcsweb_timeline_url})` when discussing disruption events
   - `[audit logs]({gcsweb_audit_url})` when discussing request gaps
   - `[etcd pod logs]({gcsweb_etcd_url})` when discussing etcd pressure
   - `[OVS vswitchd logs]({gcsweb_journal_url})` when discussing OVS stalls
3. **Tables listing runs** — include Prow and Intervals links in a column
4. **Do NOT create a separate "Artifacts" or "Links" table** — all links belong inline where
   the reader would want to click through to verify the evidence
5. **Do NOT truncate or abbreviate job names** — always use the full job name (e.g.,
   `periodic-ci-openshift-release-main-ci-4.22-e2e-azure-ovn-upgrade`, not `periodic-ci-...-e2e-azure-ovn-upgrade`)

### Report Structure

**For single run:**

```text
# Disruption Analysis

## Job Information
- **Prow Job**: [{job-name}]({prow_url})
- **Build ID**: {build_id}
- **Target**: {target}
- **Sippy Intervals**: [View intervals]({sippy_intervals_url})

## Disruption Summary
{Disruption count, backend classification, network-liveness assessment}

## Disruption Timeline
- **{from} — {to}** ({duration}s): {message}
  - Concurrent activity from [timeline]({gcsweb_timeline_url}): {events}
  - [Audit logs]({gcsweb_audit_url}): {gap analysis}

## Cluster Activity Correlation
{Reference specific artifacts inline, e.g.:}
The [timeline data]({gcsweb_timeline_url}) shows OVS vswitchd poll intervals up to 9s...
[etcd pod logs]({gcsweb_etcd_url}) confirm apply-too-long warnings at 03:56:00Z...

## Root Cause Hypothesis
{Analysis with inline links to supporting evidence}

## Other Disrupted Backends
{When --backends filter was used, list other backends that were disrupted during the
same time window and due to the same root cause. This helps readers understand the full
blast radius — e.g., if openshift-api was requested but kube-api, oauth-api, and
metrics-api were also disrupted simultaneously, that confirms a control plane problem
rather than an openshift-api-specific issue. Only include backends whose disruption
overlaps the same window; exclude unrelated disruption at other times.}
```

**For multiple runs — use the same inline linking pattern:**

```text
# Disruption Analysis: {backend_names}

## Runs Analyzed
| # | Build ID | Job | Disrupted Backends | Network Liveness |
|---|----------|-----|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | {build_id_1} ([Prow]({prow_url}) \| [Intervals]({sippy_url})) | {job} | {backends} | {status} |
| 2 | {build_id_2} ([Prow]({prow_url}) \| [Intervals]({sippy_url})) | {job} | {backends} | {status} |

## Disruption Events
### Run 1 ({build_id_1})
Phase: {upgrade|conformance} — Disruption details with [timeline]({gcsweb_timeline_url}) links

## Cluster Activity Correlation
Run 1 [timeline]({gcsweb_timeline_url_1}) shows OVS stalls at 21:50:24Z...
Run 2 [timeline]({gcsweb_timeline_url_2}) shows disk IOPS at 100% ([cloud metrics]({gcsweb_timeline_url_2}))...

## Cross-Run Comparison
{Pattern analysis referencing specific runs with inline links}

## Root Cause Hypothesis
{Synthesis with links to key evidence}

## Other Disrupted Backends
{When --backends filter was used, list other backends that were disrupted during the
same time window and due to the same root cause — not all disruption in the run, just
what overlaps the identified disruption event. Show a consolidated table with backend
name, type (cache/non-cache/cloud/canary), and how many runs (out of N) showed that
backend disrupted in the same window. Sort by runs-affected descending, then by count.
This reveals the full blast radius and helps confirm root cause — e.g., if every API
backend fails together, the problem is control-plane-wide, not backend-specific.}
```

Save the report using a filename that references the backends being analyzed:

- **Single run**: `.work/disruption-analysis/{date}/{backend_names}-analysis.md`
- **Multiple runs**: `.work/disruption-analysis/{date}/{backend_names}-analysis.md`

Where `{backend_names}` is a kebab-case join of the disrupted backend base names (e.g.,
`image-registry-new-connections-analysis.md` or `kube-api-oauth-api-analysis.md`).
If all backends are analyzed (no `--backends` filter), use the backends that actually showed
disruption. If the resulting filename would be excessively long (more than 5 backends),
truncate to the first 5 and append `-and-more` (e.g., `kube-api-oauth-api-openshift-api-cache-oauth-api-cache-openshift-api-and-more-analysis.md`).

## Error Handling

1. **No disruption found** — If interval files show no disruption events, report that the run is clean and no disruption was detected. This is a valid result, not an error.

2. **Audit logs not available** — Some jobs may not have audit logs. Note this in the report and continue analysis with available data.

3. **etcd logs not available** — If etcd pod logs are not present in gather-extra, note this and skip etcd analysis.

4. **Interval files not found** — If no interval/timeline files are found for a job run, this is a critical error for that run. Report it and skip that run if analyzing multiple runs.

5. **gcloud errors** — When `gcloud storage` commands fail, log the error, report which artifacts could not be downloaded, and continue analysis with the remaining available data.

## Performance Considerations

- Download artifacts for multiple runs in parallel when analyzing more than one run
- When analyzing multiple runs, process each run independently first, then perform cross-run comparison
- Use `--max-bytes` limits when fetching large log files to avoid excessive downloads
- Filter audit logs by timestamp range rather than downloading and scanning entire files when possible
